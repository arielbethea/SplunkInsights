Check file and directory details: <br/>

<p align="center"> 

<p>Used the ls -l command to check the file and directory details and used the ls -a command to check for hidden files. Alternatively, the ls -la command can be used to simultaneously check details of files, hidden files, and directories.
</p>
<p>There is 1 directory, 4 files, and 1 hidden file.
</p>
<br />

File permissions description:  <br/>
<p>The permissions string contains 10 characters displaying whether we are looking at a directory (d) or file (-) and the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the user, group, and other. - in place of r,w, or, x denotes a lack of that permission for a user, group, or other.</p>
<p>The first character displays whether itâ€™s a directory or file. The second through fourth characters display whether the user has read, write, and/or execute permissions. The fifth through seventh characters display whether the group has read, write, and/or execute permissions. The eighth through tenth characters display whether other has read, write, and/or execute permissions.</p>

Change file permissions:  <br/>

<p align="center"> 

<p>Only the user and group should have read and write permissions for the project_k.txt file, so I removed write permissions for other in the project_k.txt file by entering the command chmod o-w project_k.txt and confirmed the changes using the ls -l command.
</p>
<p>File project_m.txt is a restricted file that should only have permissions for the user and none for group or other. Group had read permissions, so I removed read permissions for group in the project_m.txt file by entering the command chmod g-r project_m.txt and confirmed the changes using the ls -l command.
</p>

Change file permissions on a hidden file:  <br/>

<p align="center"> 

<p>Used the ls -la command to view permissions on the hidden .project_x.txt file. Used the command chmod u=r,g=r .project_x.txt to change the permissions so that only the user and the group have read permissions. Confirmed the changes with the ls -la command.

Change directory permissions:  <br/>

<p align="center"> 

<p>Only the user should have permissions for the drafts directory, so I removed the execute permissions for the group in the drafts directory by entering the command chmod g-x drafts and confirming the changes by entering the command ls -l.

Summary:  <br/>
<p>Used the ls -l command and ls -a command to check the details of a directory and its files, including hidden files. Used the chmod command (e.g. chmod o-w project_k.txt) to remove file permissions for restricted files and used the ls-l command to confirm that changes were successful. Used the chmod command (e.g. chmod u=r,g=r .project_x.txt) to change file permissions on a hidden file and used the command ls -la to confirm the changes. Used the chmod command to change directory permissions (e.g. chmod g-x drafts) and confirmed the changes using the ls -l command.
